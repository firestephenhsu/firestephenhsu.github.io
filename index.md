# An Open Letter to Michigan State University

We are faculty, students, support staff, and allies within and outside Michigan State University demanding that Stephen Hsu be removed from his position as Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation. 

The concerns expressed by the Graduate Employees Union [[twitter]](https://twitter.com/GradEmpUnion/status/1270829003130261504) [[unrolled]](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1270829003130261504.html) and other individuals familiar with Hsu indicates an individual that cannot uphold our University Mission or [our commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://trustees.msu.edu/about/statement-diversity-inclusion.html). Given this discordance with university values, Stephen Hsu should not be privileged with the power and responsibility of recruiting and funding scholars, overseeing ethical conduct, or coordinating graduate study.

By signing this open letter we ask MSU to follow through to its commitment to be a diverse and inclusive institution and to change its institutional and administrative practices so that the passion and talent of Black scholars, Indigenous scholars, and other scholars of color (BIPOC) can be recognized and fostered within these university halls. 

We currently have **809** signatures. **You can add your signature [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdULLrcotmYTaXJ8JWOW-OFqqL_bPvANIf8XFe7-JF2o2eBfA/viewform).**
*\* Please note due to the nature of the open letter we are unable to completely verify submissions. If your name has been falsely submitted, or if there is an error with your submission, please email president@geuatmsu.org and/or organizing@geuatmsu.org*

[See another internal letter started by MSU faculty, currently signed by 546 faculty, staff, and graduate students at MSU, here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jb7w02E5GAdrJ_QnAokp7IerP_VBDridmQ-rI9M2TAE/edit) _Those at MSU are welcome to sign both petitions; this petition is intended to be available to those both inside and outside the institution. The number of signatories of each petition is not meant to be or expected to be mutually exclusive._

_Signatories of this letter agree also not to interfere with or harass any counter-petitions which arise. We condemn such measures and will follow up on any reports that our supporters are engaging in any such behavior._

# Signatures

_Last Update: June 19, 3:06 PM EST_

**Bolded** names indicate population geneticists. We highlight these individuals by their request to emphasize that Hsu's views have no basis in the scientific community.
